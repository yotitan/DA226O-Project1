1. Calculate the expected return and std deviation for each stock and the portfolio. 
How do these numbers compare between test and train data set? 

2. Calculate beta and R2 for each stock, identify high and low beta stocks, is there 
something common between the high beta stocks and low beta stocks? 

3. Using the Markowitzâ€™s optimal portfolio allocation method, compute the optimal 
weights for your portfolio.  
a. Plot the efficient frontier. What method did you use for obtaining the 
efficient frontier? 
b. Compute the performance of your portfolio in the train and the test period. 
What metrics can you use to measure the performance of the portfolio? 
c. How does your portfolio perform against the market portfolio in the same 
period?  

4. Mention the practical challenges you faced while implementing and evaluating 
your portfolio.   

5. Compute the beta of your portfolio, is it equal to the weighted average of the 
individual stocks beta in the portfolio?
